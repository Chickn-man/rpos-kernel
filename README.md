# RPOS KERNEL

RPOS is an operating system desgined for the computer in the [RedPower 2 Minecraft mod](http://www.eloraam.com/).

You can use `make TARGET={target}` to build the kernel (But its better to use one of my dedicated Makefiles)

Valid targets:

* rpc8e [(Makefile)](https://gist.github.com/Chickn-man/22831202bb981c3c42f86d37229aabeb)
